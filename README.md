# IMDb-Dataset-Sentiment-Analysis

### PROGRAMMING FOR DATA ANALYTIC

This project focuses on performing an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the IMDb movie reviews dataset, which consists of 50,000 user reviews labeled as either positive or negative. The goal is to apply basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to gain insights from the text, such as sentiment trends, word usage patterns, and review characteristics.
